# proverb-o-mat

I saw a funny [Lewis and Quark post](http://lewisandquark.tumblr.com/post/162097037117/ancient-wisdom-from-the-neural-network) creating new weighty aphorisms from old weighty aphroisms using a neural network.

I decided to test their awesome neural network against a really crappy markov chain generator.

I got gems like:

> Bun in the Earl of the ivories  
Air kiss this mortal coil  
kettle of beyond  
real McCoy - As dead sheep of the question and jetsam  
swords into the dogs of the doldrums
